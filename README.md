# Hand-Key-Point-Detection
Hand Finger Counting and Labeling with MediaPipe and OpenCV
This project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect hand landmarks and count the number of raised fingers in real-time using a webcam. The detected fingers are labeled with corresponding numbers, and the total finger count is displayed on the screen.

Key Features:

Real-time hand tracking and finger detection.
Labels each raised finger with its corresponding number.
Displays the total raised finger count in the top-left corner.
Works with a standard webcam.
Technologies Used:

MediaPipe: For hand landmark detection and tracking.
OpenCV: For image processing, video capture, and displaying results.

Use Cases:

Gesture-based control systems.
Sign language recognition.
Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) applications.
